: << 'COMMENT'

The bq tool even has its own shell, which we can activate with the following command.

COMMENT

bq shell

: << 'COMMENT'

This allows us to run many statements in sequence without typing the bq each
time. For queries, we don’t even need to type “query” — we can simply type the query
directly into the shell.

Other commands, such as ls and mk, can be run directly from the shell as well.
