Now that we’ve decided what format we’re going to use, it’s ready to go, and we’ve got
a schema for it, it’s time to load the data in. This can be done using the command-line
tool bq load. The command takes a huge variety of flags which vary based on type, but
the basic structure will look like this. This loads a CSV file with a schema we generated in
the previous step.

bq load --source_format=CSV --max_bad_records=1 ${DATASET}.${TABLE} gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/${BUCKET_FILE_NAME} ./schema.json
