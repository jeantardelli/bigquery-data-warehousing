With respect to flat files, there are really only two options: local and Google Cloud
Storage. Given the 10 MB limit and the vagaries of network connections from our
local machine to the Google Cloud perimeter, we will generally want to stage our
files in Cloud Storage first.

While we can create buckets and load files from the Google Cloud Storage UI, in this
case, a better approach is to become familiar with the command-line syntax for copying
files to a bucket. This is straightforward.

gsutil -m cp ${SOURCE} gs://${BUCKET}/${LOCATION}

The -m switch is optional and allows the copy to run in parallel. If we have
a reasonably good connection outbound to Google Cloud, this should increase
performance. A couple of caveats: Slow connections will show worse performance
because they will saturate, unable to take advantage of extra bandwidth. A parallel
process will also need to be restarted from the beginning if it fails.
