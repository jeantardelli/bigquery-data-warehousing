If our files are of unknown or poor quality, we will need to do some preprocessing on
them so they can be loaded to BigQuery. We can do this using the local files, if they’re
human-readable, accessible, and small enough to operate on. In other cases, we will
want to load them into a staging table in BigQuery first and then process them into
another table. Let’s say we have a table of the following format:

Frank,Megan,3,2005-01-03
Wu,Derek,4,2009-09-04
Stebbins,Jeff,,2008-07-12
Myerson,Kate,2,2013-09-03

This data is notably obtuse. There’s no header row, and thus it’s unclear what any of
these fields mean. The date format is ambiguous and may be YYYY-MM-DD, but could
just as easily be YYYY-DD-MM. There’s no way we’ll know what we’re looking at without
clarification. So let’s provide some context clarification. This is a list of names, GPAs, and
enrollment dates.

Let’s see what BigQuery makes of this file by running the load and showing the
generated schema.
