: << 'COMMENT'

It’s very common to load data from the command line or API instead of using the UI. The
UI can accept file uploads only up to 10 MB, and larger files have to be staged through
Google Cloud Storage first. Using the command line, we can load our file directly.

As with the UI, we can use all of the same formats, including CSV, Avro, Parquet,
JSON(L), and so on. A basic load command looks like the following.

COMMENT

bq load ${DATASET}.${TABLE} ${PATH_TO_FILE} ${FIELD_ONE}:${FIELD_ONE_TYPE},${FIELD_TWO}:${FIELD_TWO_TYPE}

: << 'COMMENT'

A Google Cloud Storage URL can be used in place of the file. The command will
automatically create the table if it doesn’t exist.
