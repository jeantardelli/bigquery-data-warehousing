Undeleting isn’t explicitly supported by the command-line tool, but if we need to
recover data from a table we accidentally deleted, we can replicate the feature by using
the same concept as the SQL construct “FOR SYSTEM TIME AS OF.”

We cannot recover a table if we overwrote it with CREATE or REPLACE, and we cannot undelete
a dataset. The limit for querying past versions of tables is 7 days. If we meet all of these
criteria, we can use this bash script to recover our data.

The first parameter is the dataset and table we want to recover, and the second parameter is
how far back we want to go in seconds. The max value is 604800 (one week).

#!/bin/bash
# Usage: bq dataset-table time-in-seconds

bq cp "$1@$(((`date+%s`-$2)*1000))" $1_recovered
