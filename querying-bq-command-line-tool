: << 'COMMENT'

Running a query using bq uses the “query” command.

By default, we’ll get a text rendering of the results. Using the --format flag, we can
specify the return in another format, including JSON, CSV, and pretty-print. CSV and
JSON are designed to be piped to file or to other locations, as in the command below.

COMMENT

bq query 'SELECT 1 AS value'
bq query --sync --format csv 'SELECT 1 AS value, "a" AS letter' > results.csv

: << 'COMMENT'

The sync parameter makes the command line wait until the query has completed,
rather than starting a job in the background. For larger commands, we should omit it
and poll the job status instead. (The UI also makes jobs in the background, but since we
are waiting for the results, it doesn’t normally come into play.
