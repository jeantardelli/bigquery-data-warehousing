Understanding service accounts may constitute part of the security
portion of your data governance program.

Service accounts are essentially user profiles for machines. Automated systems have
long discouraged using a real person’s account in any automated fashion, and the GCP-­
specific terminology for the account we use instead is the service account.

To make a service account from the cloud command lines, we can use the iam command.

Depending on the service we need to authenticate to, we add a policy
binding to give the account the appropriate scope. We can do this through the IAM
Console UI as well.
