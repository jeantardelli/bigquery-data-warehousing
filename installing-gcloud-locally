Itâ€™s also useful to have gcloud installed on our local machine
so we can do maintenance on our GCP instances without spinning up
the cloud shell.

After installing edit your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile and add the
path to the source file:

export PATH="$HOME/google-cloud-sdk/bin:$PATH"

Then, to initialize it, run:

$ gcloud init

COMMENT

curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com > install.sh
bash install.sh --disable-prompts
